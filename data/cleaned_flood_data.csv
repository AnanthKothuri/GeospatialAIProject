The initial surge of torrential rains, which pounded these areas until around 7 PM CDT or so, became a more widespread area of moderate to locally heavy rainfall later in the evening and overnight, generally along a stripe of central Hidalgo County, along and just north of Federal Highway 83.  As with Cameron and Willacy Counties earlier on the 23rd, the heaviest rains were associated with the western and southern portions of Dolly's circulation, which edged into eastern Hidalgo County by around 9 PM CDT on the 23rd, then eased northwest overnight, reaching the four corners of Jim Hogg, Brooks, Hidalgo, and Starr County at little after 230 AM on the 24th.  ||The prolonged heavy rains quickly produced high standing water, particularly in poorly draining areas of eastern Hidalgo County by late afternoon of the 23rd, including Mercedes, Elsa, and Edcouch. Residential and business flooding with some areas having at least 3 feet of water, continued through the night.  Farther west, including the more populated portions of central Hidalgo County, minor to moderate flash flooding developed later in the evening and overnight, with worst conditions favoring poor drainage locations. ||Heaviest measured and estimated rainfall included a swath of 10 inches or more from rural western Hidalgo County through the Hidalgo/Cameron and Hidalgo/Willacy County lines, immediately west and south of Dolly's Center.  This included the northern portions of Mission, McAllen, Donna, and Weslaco, as well as Edinburg and Alton.

2010,8,0,26.1129,-97.9355,TEXAS,Flood,Planned Dam Release,"Flooding of the Lower Rio Grande Valley Flood Control Project floodway/levee system (spillway), which includes the Banker Floodway (from near Granjeno to just south of Pharr), the Main Floodway (from just south of Pharr to the split at the Arroyo Colorado just southwest of Mercedes, the Arroyo Colorado itself, and the North Floodway, (which extends from near Mercedes to near La Villa before curving east to northwest Cameron County), continued through a good portion of August, as water continued to be diverted through Anzalduas for several days beyond the time that water was receding upstream of the dam.  Continuing water diversion helps reduce the potential for backwater flooding along the improved levee section (Penitas to Anzalduas) as well as unprotected shorelines west of Penitas.  At the same time, the diversion maintained several feet of water in the floodways for days to come which receded more slowly.  The floodway emptied out for the most part by August 15th, but local high water hazards continued through at least the 18th.   ||These floodways, protected by a robust system of levees and gates, protected communities outside of the levees by containing up to 50%, or 4 to 8 to feet of fast flowing water, within them into the first third of August.  Unfortunately, a number of residences, dozens of paved and unpaved roads with low water bridges, and some agriculture are located within  the floodways; significant damage was noted in several locations.  Pumping and plugging operations near Weslaco and La Villa successfully kept high water out of poor drainage locations where the potential for freshwater flooding due to heavy rains would have been exacerbated with periodic thunderstorms, which did not materialize in August.  Closed roads included  FM 493 and FM 1015, each moderately traveled; at least five homes were flooded along the Main Floodway south of Pharr along I Road; 15 to 20 homes were asked to voluntarily evacuate, and at least two other residences were flooded south of Weslaco near FM 88. Floodwaters also submerged portions of the Llano Grande golf course in Mercedes. ||Voluntary evacuations were finally lifted along I Road (Capote Farms subdivision) on August 18th at 6 PM CST, where the 15 to 20 homes mentioned above were located.  Wet, muddy conditions continued in these areas until the last week of August; damage assessments began on roadways and bridges impacted in the floodway after the waters finally receded.  In all, the floodways contained water for more than 6 weeks.||High flowing water along the river covered a large portion of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge (Santa Ana) south and southeast of Pharr, including a number of unpaved roads.  Damage to the roads was unknown at this time; the flooding occurred downstream of the Anzalduas Diversion Dam; river gages downstream at San Benito and Brownsville remained in action stage.  Floodwaters did not reach public or private structures, nor roadways, between the Refuge and the Main Floodway.  The water finally receded back to muddy pockets sometime between August 27th and 28th.||There was one reported fatality in early August; a man drowned after reportedly driving his vehicle accidentally into the fast flowing waters of the floodway late on August 1st or early on August 2nd. His body was found along the south side of the Main Floodway, near S. Jackson and W.

The rare and extreme event ultimately led to increasing water levels at both Amistad International Reservoir (northwest of Del Rio, TX) and Falcon International Reservoir (adjacent to Zapata County), the result of inflow from Mexican tributaries and upstream reservoirs along the Rio Salado and Rio Conchos in Nuevo Leon and Coahuila State, Mexico.  ||At Falcon International Reservoir, where inflow from both the upstream Mexican tributaries and Amistad International Reservoir, which had begun releases of 35,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) on July 5th, the pool level rose above conservation stage (301.2 feet) during the morning of July 12th, and would continue a steady rise, reaching moderate flood stage (306.7 feet, the point where impacts begin along the shoreline) during the pre-dawn hours of July 14th. Despite an increase in releases from 39,700 cfs to 60,000 cfs from the Reservoir, the pool level continued to rise,  peaking at a new record stage of 309.31 feet during the evening of July 17th. The continued high pool level required maintaining releases of 60,000 cubic feet per second for nearly 14 consecutive days, in order to maintain a manageable water level at the dam. At Falcon, the previous record of 308.1 feet (set in October, 1958) was not only broken, but the pool level remained above the prior record for nearly 7 full days, from around 130 AM CDT on July 15th through 930 PM on July 22nd.  The pool level was above conservation level (301.2 feet) from the morning of July 12th through 4 PM on August 13th, more than a month. ||Releases were gradually lowered toward the end of the month as the pool level began to fall more steadily heading into early August.||During the period of time when the reservoir was in moderate flood, or above 306.7 feet, structures and infrastructure was impacted along the shoreline.  At least 33 homes had some level of water incursion; damages were still being assessed as of this writing.  Lakefront roads were under some water for weeks as well.

The rare and extreme event rapidly produced major flooding along the river in Starr County, the result of planned dam releases from Falcon International Reservoir, which lasted for nearly a month, beginning on July 9th and continuing through August 3rd.  ||Releases of water from reservoirs behind dams on both sides of the border began soon after the heaviest rains from Alex ended. On July 4th, releases began at the Marte R. Gomez Reservoir, flowing into Mexican Floodways but also toward the Rio Grande bordering Starr and western Hidalgo County. On July 5th, water levels had increased sufficiently at Amistad Dam, located much farther upstream near Del Rio, Texas, to begin releases down the river. By the 7th, with waters from Amistad having created major flooding in and near Laredo, Falcon Reservoir, located along the Rio Grande including Starr and Zapata County, began releasing water. ||The initial rate of 15,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) was initially within capacity of the United States side of the flood control system, and the expectation for a potentially critical flood area between Falcon and Anzalduas Reservoir just upstream from Mission (Hidalgo County) was high water, but little if any flooding. That would quickly change on July 8th, when releases from Falcon Dam were more than doubled to 39,700 cfs (1125 cubic meters per second, cms). Soon after these releases were increased,the river quickly rose from just above flood stage (50 feet) at Rio Grande City to above major flood stage (53 feet) on July 9th.  The time it took to rise from flood stage (1320 CST July 8th) to above major flood (630 AM July 9th) was a little more than 17 hours.    ||By July 14th, outflow from Falcon Dam was raised to 60,000 cfs (1700 cms) in order to relieve pressure on the dam from the reservoir pool, which had risen steadily above conservation stage of 301.2 feet at 822 AM CST July 12th.  This release rate would both raise and swell the Rio Grande downstream; reports from local emergency management noted the river up to 2 miles wide in some spots. Prior to the peak outflow, the river crested at 57.63 feet at 6 AM July 11th, the second highest level ever recorded.

2013,10,200,30.2033,-97.8463,TEXAS,Flash Flood,Heavy Rain,"Heavy rains in excess of 14 inches upstream of Austin in the Onion Creek Watershed near Wimberley caused a flash flood that hit portions of South Austin in the early morning hours.  Water started to rise and flood portions of the Onion Creek area near Interstate 35 by 4-5am on the morning of the 31st and water continued to rise into the early morning hours.  USGS gauges were overtopped near Twin Creek Road and this record flood water continued to move along Onion creek, passing under I-35 and inundating several neighborhoods between I-35 and US Highway 183.  A reverse 911 was utilized by the City of Austin to help evacuate residents but flood waters rose so quickly that most residents sheltered in place and were rescued by truck and helicopter later that morning.  Those that tried to escape the flood waters via their vehicles got caught in the rising waters and this led to several fatalities.  A mother and infant son died when their SUV vehicle was swept off the Onion Creek bridge on Bluff Springs Road in the predawn hours around 430 am. Another resident in a neighborhood along Onion Creek was also found drowned as his vehicle got swept off the road and was recovered near Pleasant Valley Drive and William Cannon.  Almost 2 weeks later the body of a homeless man was found in Williamson Creek near South First Street and Heartwood.  He was presumed a flood fatality from this event.  Manual readings were performed by USGS at the Onion Creek/Highway 183 gauge site ATIT2.  The creek crested just over 40 feet at 930 am the morning of October 31st.  This was a new record height for this location and translated to about 135,000 cubic feet per second.

Torrential rains with rain rates of 7+ inches per hour caused massive runoff and quickly flooded the Blanco River, Onion Creek, Plum Creek, the San Marcos River and other smaller creeks and streams. Rainfall totals along I-35 were as high as 16 inches which led to significant flooding in Kyle and Buda as well. Sections of I-35 were shut down as water made the interstate impassable.  Areas of San Marcos were inundated with water, trapping people and school kids.  Dozens of swift water rescues continued during the morning and afternoon.

Rainfall amounts during the month of May across the Upper and Middle Red River basins of Southern Oklahoma and Northern Texas totaled over 20 inches of rain. The Oklahoma state climatologist reported that May of 2015 was the all time wettest month of any month in state history. Lake Texhoma, a flood control reservoir to the Red River upstream of Arthur City, Texas rose to its highest pool stage on record early on June 1st at 645.66 feet with peak releases of around 140,000 CFS. The Muddy Boggy Creek tributary to the Red River rose to near its flood of record cresting near 55 feet earlier on May 29th with inflows upwards of 70,000 CFS into the Red River. Muddy Boggy Creek crested just shy of the 1990 flood of record with 55.27 feet near Unger, Oklahoma. Other tributaries of the Red River also crested at very high levels during the final week of May and early in June, 2015 below Lake Texhoma including Bois D'Arc and Bokchito Creeks. Finally the Kiamichi River at Hugo Reservoir crested just below a new pool stage record after May 25th and contributed peak releases of near 60,000 CFS as well to the Red River. This excessive heavy rainfall and inflow into the Red River resulted in river levels that eclipsed the flood of May of 1990 at Pecan Point and was just shy of the Red River flood of May of 1908 at Pecan Point. The Red River at Pecan Point north of Dekalb, Texas went above the 24 foot flood stage on May 10th, 2015 and remained above that flood stage through the entire month of June and did not fall below flood stage until until July, 2015. The Red River at Pecan Point north of Dekalb, Texas went above the 30 foot major flood stage on May 24th, 2015 and crested at a stage of 35.0 feet on June 2nd, 2015.

The river fell below the 30 foot major flood stage on June 10th. A secondary rise on the Red River developed because of excessive heavy rainfall once again in the middle Red River Basin from the remnants of Tropical Storm Bill. As a result, the Red River at Pecan Point north of Dekalb, Texas went back above the 30 foot major flood stage on June 22nd and crested at a stage of 32.5 feet on June 24th. The Red River then fell below the 30 foot major flood stage on June 28th.  Below Pecan Point north of Dekalb, Texas, the Red River at Index, Arkansas crested at 31.4 feet on June 3rd.  This was the 3rd highest flood at Index, Arkansas in recorded history at the gauging location, eclipsed only by the flood of record of 34.4 feet in 1938 and 32.3 feet in 1990. The river fell below the 28 foot major flood stage on June 8th. A secondary rise on the Red River developed because of excessive heavy rainfall once again in the middle Red River Basin from the remnants of Tropical Storm Bill.
