The tornado developed just south of U.S. Highway 84 at 19:56 CST. The tornado quickly crossed U.S. Highway 84 five miles northwest of Shallowater, where a National Weather Service damage survey team found tumble weeds suspended within utility wires. The tornado then tracked north-northeastward to the west of Farm to Market Road 179.  The tornado downed utility poles, damaged four structures, a livestock trailer, and additionally uprooted a large tree before crossing the Lubbock and Hale County line one mile west of the County Line community. ||Two mobile homes sustained minor damage from the tornado. Skirting was removed from one home, and mud splatters were evident on the structure. A large roof panel was additionally removed from a second mobile home along county roads west of Farm to Market 179. A well-built permanent house sustained minor damage immediately southwest of County Line, near the Lubbock and Hale County line. A carport and outbuilding were destroyed at the residence and minor roof damage occurred from debris loaded wind. In addition, a large metal garage structure on the property was partially collapsed when tornadic winds caused the door to fail. A large boat stored within the structure was subsequently damaged when it was pushed by wind-loaded debris through a portion of the structure's back wall. ||By 20:15 CST drier air began to occlude the tornadic circulation. This allowed visibility around the tornado to improve and a National Weather Service employee began witnessing and photographing the tornado and associated utility power flashes as it approached the Lubbock and Hale County line. The tornado blew down approximately a dozen wooden utility poles along its path as it crossed into Hale County one mile west of the County Line community at 20:16 CST. ||The tornado continued until 20:20 CST in southwestern Hale County, where it resulted in additional damages to farm implements, utility poles, and an oil field shed. Damages to the two mobile homes, a single family residence and metal garage, trees, and to wooden utility poles support an EF-1 rating with estimated wind speeds between 85 and 95 mph.

Broken glass was everywhere, but, in spite of cuts and bruises, they took shelter in a small nearby roofless shack as hail continued to fall.  He then walked, carrying an injured son and daughter, to a neighbor���s house to call for help.  His truck, parked under an awning just south of the mobile home was rolled and crushed.
